# Litrature Review

## A Review of Portfolio Construction Algorithms

### Introduction

Since Harry Markovitz's (1952) seminal work on mean variance portfolios scholars around the globe have been aspiring to develop a robust algorithm capable of ___ex ante___ situating a portfolio on the efficient frontier [@Markovitz]. There are now a wide array of alternatives, with many more in the making.

These optimisers however are not without their flaws. Mean variance optimisers rely heavily on the accuracy of return forecasts, where small errors often lead to vastly different returns [@lopez]. Furthermore, quadratic programming methods used in portfolio optimisation require the inversion of some positive-definite covariance matrix, which can be susceptible to error if the covariance matrix suffers from a high condition number ^[A condition number is defined as the absolute value of the ratio between a covariance matrix's largest and smallest eigenvalues [@lopez]] [@lopez; @lopez2012]. Diagonal matrices have the smallest condition number which increases as more correlated variables are added. A small change in correlation within any given entry can greatly alter the inverse of a high conditional number matrix, __which in turn can greatly effect the portfolio weights__ [@lopez]. For a given sample size, larger co-variance matrices are prone to more noise in estimation. This si essentially due to a reduction in degrees of freedom as a sample of at least $1/2N(N+1)$ independent and identically distributed (iid) observations are required to estimate an $N\times N$ covariance matrix. This issues is exacerbated by the fact that a markets covariance structure tends to vary over time [@lopez].

Due to the sensitivity issues surrounding errors in the expected return estimation, this work will only discuss the portfolio optimisation techniques that forego this input. These include the naive equal weight, inverse variance, hierarchical risk parity, ERC and the minimum variance portfolios. _The theoretical underpinnings of each will be reviewed as well as their relative performance in historical back tests_.

### Minimum Variance
Portfolio optimisers designed to exhibit the minimum variance have garnered allot of attention for themselves, largely to their tendency to achieve surprisingly high returns in historical back tests [@clarke2011]. This performance has been attributed to the surprising fact that both low volatility stocks tend to earn returns in excess of the market, and that high beta stocks tend not to be rewarded by higher returns [@clark2011; @fama1992]. These minimum variance portfolios tend to achieve cumulative returns equal to or slightly greater than market portfolio's whilst maintaining consistently lower variance and achieving a noticeable improvement in downside risk mitigation in times of crisis [@clarke].

_Who developed the min variance portfolio??_

The weight attributed to an given security in the long-only minimum-variance portfolio is given in Eq. \ref{minvar_eq} [@clarke].

\begin{align} 
\label{minvar_eq} w_i=\sigma^2_{MV}/\sigma^2_{\epsilon i}(1-\beta_i/\beta_{L})\ \ for \ \ \beta_i<\beta_L \ \ else\ w_i=0
\end{align}

where

+ $\sigma^2_{LMV}$ is the ex ante return variance of the long-only minimum variance portfolio.
+ $\sigma^2_{\epsilon i}$ is the ex ante idiosyncratic return variance for security i.
+ $\beta_i$ ex ante market beta for security i.
+ $\beta_{L}$ is the long-only threshold beta.

The simplicity of Eq. \ref{minvar_eq} can be attributed to the simplifying assumption of single index risk and the expected returns being absent from the objective function. Eq. \ref{minvar_eq} indicates that asset weights depend on two portfolio specific risk parameters, the ex ante variance of the long-only portfolio and the long only threshold beta, and two security specific risk parameters, the market beta and the idiosyncratic return variance [@clarke]. High market beta and idiosyncratic variance reduce an assets optimal weight towards zero, while a market beta greater than long-only threshold results in a optimal weight of zero [@clark]. Interestingly empirical results indicate that the long-only minimum variance portfolio tends to apply a zero weight to approximately 80% of investable securities. 

__mention first rule of investing??__

### Equally-Weighted Risk Contributions (ERC)
The ERC portfolio is another optimiser that avoids using expected returns and is therefore said to be more robust [@maillard]. The basic idea behind the ERC is to weight the portfolio such that each security contributes equally to risk [@maillard]. The ERC portfolio $x=(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ consisting of n assets is designed as follows: 

### Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP)
Due to the multitude of robustness issues related to traditional portfolio optimisers, @lopez developed a new approach incorporating machine-learning methods and graph theory [@arevalo]. @lopez argues that the "lack of hierarchical structure in a correlation matrix allows weights to vary freely in
unintended way" and that this contributes to the instability issues. His HRP algorithm requires only a singular covariance matrix and can utilize the information within without the need for the positive definite property [@lopex]. This procedure works in three stages:

1) Tree clustering: This involves utilizing a hierarchical tree clustering method such that security weights can be determined downstream through a tree graph [@lopez]. 

2) Quasi-diagonalization: this stage reorganizes the covariances matrix so that similar securities are placed near one another while dissimilar securities are far apart. This is done through an algorithm that situates the largest covariances near the diagonal and smaller covariances further away [@lopez].

3) Recursive bisection: Portfolio funds are then allocated top down through the tree structure such that riskier clusters receive fewer funds. This can be accomplished through the inverse-variance allocation [@lopez].

Note that each of the three steps _(or just step 1 and 3??)_ can be completed with an range of alternative techniques, which in turn effect the solution.

@lopez carried out an in sample simulation study comparing the respective allocations of the long-only minimum variance, IVP and HRP portfolios using a covariance matrix using a condition number that is "not unfavourable" to the minimum variance portfolio. The simulated data consisted of 10000 observations across 10 variables. The following findings were made: The minimum variance portfolio concentrated 92.66% of funds in the top 5 holdings and assigned a zero weight to 3 assets. _Conversly_, HRP only assigned 62.5% of its funds to the top 5 holdings [@lopez]. The minimum variance portfolio's objective function causes it to build highly concentrated portfolio's in favour of a small reduction in volatility; the HRP portfolio had only a slightly higher volatility [@lopez]. This apparent diversification advantage achieved by the minimum variance portfolio is rather deceptive as the portfolio remains highly susceptible to idiosyncratic risk incidents within its top holdings [@lopez]. This claim was further validated by the finding that HRP achieved significantly lower out of sample variance compared to the minimum variance portfolio. 

### Inverse Variance Portfolio (IVP)


# Data  {-}

Notice how I used the curly brackets and dash to remove the numbering of the data section.

Discussion of data should be thorough with a table of statistics and ideally a figure.

In your tempalte folder, you will find a Data and a Code folder. In order to keep your data files neat, store all of them in your Data folder. Also, I strongly suggest keeping this Rmd file for writing and executing commands, not writing out long pieces of data-wrangling. In the example below, I simply create a ggplot template for scatter plot consistency. I suggest keeping all your data in a data folder.

<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

```{r Figure1,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}

  # This is just a random plot to show you a plot. This is done if the getwd() does not point to your Template's directory.
  # Set WD below to your project's working directory.

  g <-
  ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = disp, y = hp, color = cyl)) +
  theme_bw() +
  # theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10)) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title.x = element_text()) +
  labs(y = "y-axis", x = "x-axis", title = "Some amazing plot")

g

```

To make your graphs look extra nice in latex world, you could use Tikz device. Replace dev - 'png' with 'tikz' in the chunk below. Notice this makes the build time longer and produces extra tex files - so if you are comfortable with this, set your device to Tikz and try it out:

```{r Figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure2}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}

ExampleData <- read_rds( "data/Example_data.rds")

source("code/Example_Plot_Scatter.R") # Load a function from your 'code' folder. This e.g. plots scatters to your own preferences.
source( "code/Data_Create.R") #

ExampleData <- Data_Create(N = 100) # Same as the ExampleData loaded above - this is just a function to create the stored data.

g <- Example_Plot_Scatter(DataInput = ExampleData,
                          X = "Height_Score",
                          Y = "Weight_Score",
                          Z = "Agility_Score",
                          Theme = theme_bw(), # run ?ggthemes for other themes.
                          Title = "", # I prefer to use the caption set above.
                          Ylab = "Height",
                          Xlab = "Lenght",
                          LegendTitle = "Agility",
                          TitleSize = 10,
                          LabSize = 10)

g

# Although the functions above are really simple, the principle is simple: containing calculations and data wrangling in their own functions will make this template much cleaner and more manageable.
# When you start working, delete these meaningless functions and replace with your own...

```

To reference the plot above, add a ``\\label'' after the caption in the chunk heading, as done above. Then reference the plot as such: As can be seen, Figures \ref{Figure1}  and \ref{Figure2} are excellent, with Figure \ref{Figure2} being particularly aesthetically pleasing due to its device setting of Tikz. The nice thing now is that it correctly numbers all your figures (and sections or tables) and will update if it moves. The links are also dynamic.

I very strongly suggest using ggplot2 (ideally in combination with dplyr) using the ggtheme package to change the themes of your figures.

Also note the information that I have placed above the chunks in the code chunks for the figures. You can edit any of these easily - visit the Rmarkdown webpage for more information.

# Splitting a page

You can also very easily split a page using the format below:


:::::: {.columns data-latex="[T]"}
::: {.column data-latex="{0.7\textwidth}"}
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .2, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19)
```
:::
::: {.column data-latex="{0.05\textwidth}"}
\
<!-- an empty Div (with a white space), serving as
a column separator -->
:::
::: {.column data-latex="{0.2\textwidth}"}
<!-- To make this text a bit smaller, use \scriptsize, \small, \footnotesize or \normal. There are other size too - google latex sizes. -->
\scriptsize

## Data {-}
The figure on the left-hand side shows the `cars` data.

#  Methodology \label{Meth}

## Subsection
Ideally do not overuse subsections. It equates to bad writing.^[This is an example of a footnote by the way. Something that should also not be overused.]

## Math section

Equations should be written as such:

\begin{align}
\beta = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma_{t-1}^2} \label{eq1} \\
\int_{x = 1}^{\infty}x_{i} = 1 \notag
\end{align}

If you would like to see the equations as you type in Rmarkdown, use $ symbols instead (see this for yourself by adjusted the equation):

$$
\beta = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma_{t-1}^2} \\
\int_{x = 1}^{\infty}x_{i} = 1
$$

Note again the reference to equation \ref{eq1}. Writing nice math requires practice. Note I used a forward slashes to make a space in the equations. I can also align equations using  __\&__, and set to numbering only the first line. Now I will have to type ``begin equation'' which is a native \LaTeX command. Here follows a more complicated equation:


\begin{align}
	y_t &= c + B(L) y_{t-1} + e_t   \label{eq2}    \\ \notag
	e_t &= H_t^{1/2}  z_t ; \quad z_t \sim  N(0,I_N) \quad \& \quad H_t = D_tR_tD_t \\ \notag
		D_t^2 &= {\sigma_{1,t}, \dots, \sigma_{N,t}}   \\ \notag
		\sigma_{i,t}^2 &= \gamma_i+\kappa_{i,t}  v_{i, t-1}^2 +\eta_i  \sigma_{i, t-1}^2, \quad \forall i \\ \notag
		R_{t, i, j} &= {diag(Q_{t, i, j}}^{-1}) . Q_{t, i, j} . diag(Q_{t, i, j}^{-1})  \\ \notag
		Q_{t, i, j} &= (1-\alpha-\beta)  \bar{Q} + \alpha  z_t  z_t'  + \beta  Q_{t, i, j} \notag
\end{align}

Note that in \ref{eq2} I have aligned the equations by the equal signs. I also want only one tag, and I create spaces using ``quads''.

See if you can figure out how to do complex math using the two examples provided in \ref{eq1} and \ref{eq2}.

# Results

Tables can be included as follows. Use the _xtable_ (or kable) package for tables. Table placement = H implies Latex tries to place the table Here, and not on a new page (there are, however, very many ways to skin this cat. Luckily there are many forums online!).


```{r ShortTable, results = 'asis'}

library(xtable)
data <- mtcars[1:5,] %>% tibble::as_tibble()

table <- xtable(data, caption = "Short Table Example \\label{tab1}")
  print.xtable(table,
             # tabular.environment = "longtable",
             floating = TRUE,
             table.placement = 'H',
             # scalebox = 0.3,
             comment = FALSE,
             caption.placement = 'bottom'
             )

```

To reference calculations __in text__, _do this:_ From table \ref{tab1} we see the average value of mpg is `r mean(mtcars[1:5,]$mpg)`.

Including tables that span across pages, use the following (note that I add below the table: ``continue on the next page''). This is a neat way of splitting your table across a page.

Use the following default settings to build your own possibly long tables. Note that the following will fit on one page if it can, but cleanly spreads over multiple pages:

```{r LongTable, results = 'asis'}

library(xtable)

data = mtcars %>% tibble::as_tibble()
  addtorow          <- list()
  addtorow$pos      <- list()
  addtorow$pos[[1]] <- c(0)
  addtorow$command  <- c(paste("\\hline \n",
                               "\\endhead \n",
                               "\\hline \n",
                               "{\\footnotesize Continued on next page} \n",
                               "\\endfoot \n",
                               "\\endlastfoot \n",sep=""))
table <- xtable(data, caption = "Long Table Example")
  print.xtable(table,
             tabular.environment = "longtable",
             floating = FALSE, # Leave this as is.
             table.placement = 'H', # Leave this as is.
             booktabs = T, # Aesthetics
             include.rownames = FALSE,  # Typically you don't want this in a table.
             add.to.row = addtorow, # For adding the Continued on next page part...
             comment = FALSE,
             caption.placement = 'top',  # Where do you want the caption?
             size="\\fontsize{12pt}{13pt}\\selectfont"  # Size of text in table..
             )
# See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/vignettes/xtableGallery.pdf for table inspiration
```

\hfill

<!-- hfill can be used to create a space, like here between text and table. -->


## Huxtable

Huxtable is a very nice package for making working with tables between Rmarkdown and Tex easier.

This cost some adjustment to the Tex templates to make it work, but it now works nicely.

See documentation for this package [here](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/huxtable.html). A particularly nice addition of this package is for making the printing of regression results a joy (see [here](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/huxtable.html#creating-a-regression-table)). Here follows an example:


If you are eager to use huxtable, comment out the Huxtable table in the Rmd template, and uncomment the colortbl package in your Rmd's root.

Note that I do not include this in the ordinary template, as some latex users have complained it breaks when they build their Rmds (especially those using tidytex - I don't have this problem as I have the full Miktex installed on mine). Up to you, but I strongly recommend installing the package manually and using huxtable. To make this work, uncomment the _Adding additional latex packages_ part in yaml at the top of the Rmd file. Then comment out the huxtable example in the template below this line. Reknit, and enjoy.

```{r, results = 'asis'}

if(!require(huxtable)) install.packages(huxtable)
library(huxtable)
data(diamonds, package = 'ggplot2')
Title <- "Regression Output"
Label <- "Reg01"
lm1 <- lm(price ~ carat, diamonds)
lm2 <- lm(price ~ depth, diamonds)
lm3 <- lm(price ~ carat + depth, diamonds)
htab <-
huxreg(lm1, lm2, lm3,
                statistics = c(N = "nobs", R2 = "r.squared"),
                note = "%stars%.") %>%
  set_caption(Title) %>%
  set_label(Label)
# More settings:
font_size(htab) <- 12
# Let's change regression names: this is slightly hacky, but works. Comment out this section to see what the default looks like:
  Names <- c( "Reg1", "Reg2", "Reg3")
  for(i in 1:length(Names)) {
    htab[1,][[1+i]] <- Names[i]
  }
# Now simply call the table:
htab

```

FYI - R also recently introduced the gt package, which is worthwhile exploring too.

# Lists

To add lists, simply using the following notation

* This is really simple

    + Just note the spaces here - writing in R you have to sometimes be pedantic about spaces...

* Note that Rmarkdown notation removes the pain of defining \LaTeX environments!

# Conclusion

I hope you find this template useful. Remember, stackoverflow is your friend - use it to find answers to questions. Feel free to write me a mail if you have any questions regarding the use of this package. To cite this package, simply type citation("Texevier") in Rstudio to get the citation for @Texevier (Note that uncited references in your bibtex file will not be included in References).
